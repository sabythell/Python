#instructions:
    #You have been given a basic version of a video game rentals program (It's like I've been looking back through the old code or something!), 
    # extend this program so that it:
    #Uses a 2D list to store the data
    #Uses autosave to store the data in a file called gameRentals.txt
    #Use autoload to load the 2D list from the gameRentals.txt file on each load
    #You'll see that the program also contains a list of customers in a file called customers.txt, write some autoload code to create a list called customers that loads this data
    #Extend the program to be able to create customers
    #Write an autosave function to be able to save the customers list back to customers.txt, you should not delete any existing customers whilst doing this
    #Extension
    #Go back through any of your other exercise files that used 2D lists and add in code to use autosave and autoload, making sure that the file names 
    #you are using to store you data in are sensible

    #example customers.txt [['Ian Smith', 'ian@test.com'], ['Penny Morgan', 'penny@test.com']]
